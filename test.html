        <h2>1. Date Summary</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Response Rate</h3>
        <p>
            For this research, the team invited approximately 35 participants through various platforms, including Discord, social media, and personal outreach. The goal was to engage a broad audience of YouTube users who could provide relevant insights on their experiences and interest in an audio-only feature.
        </p>
        <h4>Total Responses Received</h4>
        <p>
            A total of 20 responses were collected through the survey. This included participants who provided detailed feedback on their YouTube usage habits, preferences for video versus audio, and interest in an audio-only feature.
        </p>
        <h4>Response Rate Calculation</h4>
        <p>
            <bold>Using the formula</bold> Response Rate = (Total Responses/Total Invitation Sent) x 100        </p>
        <p>
            Response Rate = (20/50) x 100 = 57%

        </p>
        <p>
            A 57% response rate reflects moderate engagement and interest from the targeted participant pool, suggesting that the outreach methods were effective in reaching individuals interested in YouTubeâ€™s functionalities.
        </p>
 

        <h3>1.2 Total Responses</h3>

        <h4>Total Surveys Completed</h4>
        <p>
            20 participants completed the survey, providing insights into their YouTube usage habits, interest in an audio-only feature, and feedback on video vs. audio preferences.
        </p>
        <h4>Total Interviews Conducted</h4>
        <p>
            In addition to the survey, 4 in-depth interviews were conducted to gather qualitative insights. These interviews allowed for a more detailed exploration of user behaviours and preferences that may not be fully captured in the survey.
        </p>
        <h4>Response Distribution</h4>
        <p>
            The data collection consisted primarily of survey responses, with a smaller sample of in-depth interviews to support and validate the quantitative findings. This balanced approach provided both a broad overview of user preferences and deeper insights into specific user experiences.
        </p>
        This data shows that a majority of participants are frequent users of YouTube, with nearly half using it daily. This high engagement level suggests a vested interest in potential new features like an audio-only mode.
        <h3>1.3 Participant Demographics</h3>

        <p><bold>Age Range: </bold>The ages of participants ranged from 18 to 45 years old. This demographic range includes:
        </p>
        <p>
            Younger Users (18-25): 8 participants
        </p>
        <p>
            Mid-Age Users (26-35): 9 participants
        </p>
        <p>
            Older Users (36-45): 3 participants
        </p>
        <p>
            This diversity in age provides insights into preferences across different age groups, allowing us to understand if there are generational trends in YouTube usage and interest in audio-only features.
        </p>

        <h4>YouTube Usage Frequency</h4>
        <p>
            The frequency of YouTube usage among participants varied:
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Daily Users: </bold> 9 participants (45%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Several Times a Week: </bold> 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Once a Week: </bold> 3 participants (15%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>A Few Times a Week: </bold> 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Rarely: </bold> 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
        <p>
            This data shows that a majority of participants are frequent users of YouTube, with nearly half using it daily. This high engagement level suggests a vested interest in potential new features like an audio-only mode.
        </p>

        <h4>Frequency of Using YouTube Without Watching Video</h4>
        <p>
            Participants reported how often they use YouTube solely for audio (without watching the video):
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Always: </bold> 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Often: </bold> 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Sometimes: </bold> 6 participants (30%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Rarely: </bold> 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p>
            <bold>Never: </bold> 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
        <p>
            The data reveals that many users are already using YouTube in an audio-only capacity, highlighting the demand for a dedicated audio feature.
