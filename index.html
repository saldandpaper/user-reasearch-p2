            1. Data Summary
        </h1>
        <h2 >
            1.1 Response Rate:
        </h2>
        <p >
            For this research, the team invited approximately 35 participants through
            various platforms, including Discord, social media, and personal outreach.
            The goal was to engage a broad audience of YouTube users who could provide
            relevant insights on their experiences and interest in an audio-only
            feature.
        </p>
        <h3 >
            Total Responses Received:
        </h3>
        <p >
            A total of 20 responses were collected through the survey. This included
            participants who provided detailed feedback on their YouTube usage habits,
            preferences for video versus audio, and interest in an audio-only feature.
        </p>
        <h3 >
            Response Rate Calculation:
        </h3>
        <p >
            Using the formula: Response Rate = (Total Responses/Total Invitation Sent) x
            100
        </p>
        
        <p >
            Response Rate = (20/50) x 100 = 57%
        </p>
        
        <p >
            A 57% response rate reflects moderate engagement and interest from the
            targeted participant pool, suggesting that the outreach methods were
            effective in reaching individuals interested in YouTube’s functionalities.

            Total Interviews Conducted:
        </h3>
        <p >
            In addition to the survey, 4 in-depth interviews were conducted to gather
            qualitative insights. These interviews allowed for a more detailed
            exploration of user behaviours and preferences that may not be fully
            captured in the survey.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Response Distribution:
        </h3>
        <p >
            The data collection consisted primarily of survey responses, with a smaller
            sample of in-depth interviews to support and validate the quantitative
            findings. This balanced approach provided both a broad overview of user
            preferences and deeper insights into specific user experiences.
        </p>

        <p >
            Older Users (36-45): 3 participants
        </p>
         
        <p >
            This diversity in age provides insights into preferences across different
            age groups, allowing us to understand if there are generational trends in
            YouTube usage and interest in audio-only features.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            YouTube Usage Frequency:
        </h3>
         
        <p >
            The frequency of YouTube usage among participants varied:
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Daily Users: 9 participants (45%)
        </p>
        <p >
            Several Times a Week: 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p >
            Once a Week: 3 participants (15%)
        </p>
        <p >
            A Few Times a Month: 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Rarely: 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
        <p >
            This data shows that a majority of participants are frequent users of
            YouTube, with nearly half using it daily. This high engagement level
            suggests a vested interest in potential new features like an audio-only
            mode.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Frequency of Using YouTube Without Watching Video:
        </h3>
         
        <p >
            Participants reported how often they use YouTube solely for audio (without
            watching the video):
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Always: 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p >
            Often: 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p >
            Sometimes: 6 participants (30%)

        <p >
            Rarely: 4 participants (20%)
        </p>
        <p >
            Never: 2 participants (10%)
        </p>
         
        <p >
            The data reveals that many users are already using YouTube in an audio-only
            capacity, highlighting the demand for a dedicated audio feature.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Internet Speed and Its Effect on Playback:
        </h3>
         
        <p >
            Participants shared information about their typical internet speed and how
            it impacts their YouTube experience:
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Excellent, and rarely disrupts playback: 6 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Good, with occasional buffering: 6 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Average, with frequent interruptions: 4 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Unlikely: 2 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            No: 2 participants
        </p>
         
        <p >
            A strong interest in the audio-only feature is evident, with 8 participants
            expressing definite interest and an additional 4 participants indicating
            potential interest.

            When asked how likely they would be to use an audio-only feature:
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Very likely: 8 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Likely: 4 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Neutral: 4 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Unlikely: 2 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            Very unlikely: 2 participants
        </p>
         
        <p >
            This response reinforces the positive reception of an audio-only feature,
            with the majority indicating they would be very likely or likely to use it.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Knowledge of Third-Party Mirrors for YouTube Audio-Only Content:
        </h3>
         
        <p >
            Some participants were aware of third-party services that allow audio-only
            playback:
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Yes: 8 participants
        </p>
        <p >
            No: 12 participants
        </p>
         
        <p >
            This suggests that a notable segment of users is already aware of or using
            alternative methods to access audio-only content, indicating an unmet need
            that YouTube could address directly.

            notable comments include:
        </p>
         
        <p >
            “Would love an audio-only mode for music!”
        </p>
        <p >
            “An audio-only option would be a game-changer for commutes.”
        </p>
        <p >
            “I rarely use YouTube for just audio, so not a priority.”
        </p>
        <p >
            “Audio-only would save a lot of data, especially with poor internet access.”
        </p>
        <p >
            “Not interested in audio-only; YouTube is mainly for video for me.”
        </p>
         
        <p >
            These comments reveal both support and reservations, with many users
            highlighting data savings and convenience, while others emphasise that
            YouTube’s visual content is a primary attraction.

        <p >
            The survey responses were generally detailed and relevant, with most
            participants providing thoughtful answers to each question. This indicates
            that respondents took the time to consider their responses, contributing to
            high-quality data. The survey responses included a mix of quantitative and
            qualitative insights, with specific comments about their YouTube usage
            habits and interest in an audio-only feature. Some participants also offered
            additional suggestions, enriching the data with user perspectives on
            YouTube’s current functionalities.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Interview Data Quality:
        </h3>
        <p >
            The in-depth interviews yielded valuable insights that went beyond the
            survey data. Participants provided detailed accounts of their YouTube usage
            patterns, the impact of internet speed on their experience, and specific
            scenarios where an audio-only feature would be beneficial. This allowed for
            a deeper understanding of user needs and preferences. The interview data was
            especially useful for identifying pain points, such as data consumption
            concerns and the need for uninterrupted audio playback.

        <p >
            Overall, there was consistency in responses, with common themes emerging
            around data-saving benefits, battery efficiency, and the flexibility to
            listen without video. However, a few participants mentioned they primarily
            use YouTube for visual content, showing a range of preferences.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Challenges in Data Quality:
        </h3>
        <p >
            A small portion of survey responses were brief or vague, indicating that
            some participants may not have fully engaged with every question. This did
            not significantly impact the overall findings but is noted as a minor
            limitation.
        </p>
         
        <p >
            In summary, the data collected is of high quality, providing both broad and
            in-depth insights into user interest in an audio-only YouTube feature. The
            mix of quantitative survey results and qualitative interview feedback
            strengthens the reliability of the findings.

            3. Reflection on Data Collection Experience
        </h1>
         
        <p >
            In this phase, our team implemented the UX research plan by conducting
            surveys and interviews to gather insights into YouTube users’ interest in an
            audio-only feature. This reflection outlines our experience with data
            collection, discussing successes, challenges, and potential improvements for
            future research.

            3.1 Expected vs. Actual Process
        </h2>
         
        <h3 >
            Initial Expectations:
        </h3>
        <p >
            We anticipated collecting responses primarily from frequent YouTube users
            who would have strong opinions on the platform’s features. Based on our
            outreach strategy, we expected a high engagement rate, particularly in
            Discord communities and among social media groups interested in music and
            streaming.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Actual Experience:
        </h3>
        <p >
            Overall, the data collection process went as planned, with 20 survey
            responses and a few in-depth interviews completed. The response rate was
            close to our expectations, though engagement in some communities was lower
            than anticipated. Participants generally provided detailed answers,
            especially in the interview sessions, where they elaborated on their use of
            YouTube and potential benefits of an audio-only feature.

            3.2 Challenges Encountered
        </h2>
         
        <h3 >
            Recruitment Challenges:
        </h3>
        <p >
            Finding participants outside our personal networks proved challenging, as
            some online communities showed limited engagement. Despite our outreach
            efforts in Discord and social media, participation was not as high in
            certain groups, possibly due to the niche nature of the topic.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Data Quality Variability:
        </h3>
        <p >
            While most responses were insightful, a few survey responses lacked depth,
            with some participants providing brief or vague answers. This was
            particularly evident in questions about additional suggestions, where some
            responses were minimal.
        </p>
         
         
        <h3 >
            Technical and Logistical Issues:
        </h3>
        <p >
            Scheduling interviews was sometimes difficult, as participants had varying
            availability. Additionally, coordinating within our team to manage data
            collection and maintain consistency in interviews required careful planning.
        </p>
         
        <h2 >
            3.3 Improvements for Future Data Collection
        </h2>
         
        <h3 >
            Enhanced Recruitment Strategy:
        </h3>
        <p >
            For future studies, we would expand recruitment to include more diverse
            online platforms and explore offering incentives to encourage participation.
            Broadening the outreach to other social media channels and potentially
            targeting YouTube-specific forums could attract a more engaged participant
            pool.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Simplifying Survey Questions:
        </h3>
        <p >
            To ensure high-quality responses, we would consider refining and clarifying
            survey questions further. For example, rephrasing questions to be more
            straightforward may improve response depth, especially for open-ended
            sections.
        </p>
         
        <h3 >
            Structured Interview Guide:
        </h3>
        <p >
            During the interviews, a more structured guide could help streamline
            responses and ensure we capture key insights efficiently. This would also
            reduce the variability in responses and focus on specific areas relevant to
            our research questions.
        </p>
         
        <p >
            In summary, the data collection phase was successful, though it revealed
            some areas for improvement. By refining our recruitment approach, question
            clarity, and interview process, we could enhance data quality and ensure
            even more meaningful insights in future phases.

            4. Conclusion
        </h1>
         
        <p >
            This phase of our research provided valuable insights into YouTube users’
            habits and their interest in an audio-only feature. Through surveys and
            in-depth interviews, we identified key trends, including the high frequency
            of YouTube usage and significant interest in an audio-focused experience.
            Our findings show that many users already use YouTube as an audio-only
            platform, reinforcing the demand for a feature that allows audio playback
            without video streaming. Additionally, the data highlighted specific
            benefits users seek, such as reduced data consumption, extended battery
            life, and uninterrupted audio streaming.
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Despite some challenges in participant recruitment and data quality
            variability, our overall data collection process was effective. The feedback
            gathered not only validates the potential appeal of an audio-only option but
            also provides YouTube with actionable insights on user preferences and
            potential areas for enhancement.
        </p>
         
        <p >
            Moving forward, the insights from this phase will guide us in refining our
            recommendations and developing a prototype or concept for an audio-only
            feature. By addressing the identified challenges and implementing the
            suggested improvements, we can enhance future research phases and continue
            building a comprehensive case for introducing this feature on YouTube.

                    I wouldn't really use the audio only feature even if podcasts were
                    provided, as I don't really use podcasts as much as I used to

                    I think my usage might increase for a bit to try out the features,
                    though I don't really see myself using the audio only feature as I
                    tend to enjoy and am okay with just leaving my tablet open next to
                    me while I listen passively to the video content.

            Data Quality

        <p >
            Data was collected to understand usage patterns, potential for feature
            introduction and if people even want the feature for a wider range of videos
            instead of just videos that were chosen for YouTube Music. After the
            questions were geared toward seeing if YouTube has to worry about
            competition.

            Collection Period

            3 of the 4 interviews were conducted within 2 days and the last one was done
            one week after. So over all collection time was 9 days

            Any person that could be contacted and called over on short notice was
            chosen. Most candidates are SAIT students with medium to high YouTube usage.
